# Local CI Checks - Optimized for running with `act`
#
# Usage:
#   act -j local-checks          # Run all local checks
#   act -j analyze               # Run only analysis
#   act -j test                  # Run only tests
#
# Requirements:
#   - Docker must be running
#   - Install act: https://github.com/nektos/act
#
# Note: This workflow is designed to work without secrets
# for local development. Use pr-checks.yml for actual PRs.
