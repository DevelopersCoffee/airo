# 🤖 Airo Agent Operating Rules

> **Last Updated:** 2025-11-30  
> **Version:** 1.0.0  
> **Project Board:** https://github.com/orgs/DevelopersCoffee/projects/2

## 📋 Rule Updates

When updating these rules:
1. Create a PR with changes to this file
2. Tag with `docs` label
3. Get approval from project maintainer
4. Update version number and date

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. GitHub is the Single Source of Truth
- ❌ NO local task tracking (`.vscode/agents/` is reference only)
- ✅ All tasks tracked as GitHub Issues
- ✅ All progress updated on GitHub Project Board
- ✅ All discussions in Issue comments
- ✅ All decisions documented in PRs or ADRs

### 2. Agents are On-Demand, Not Always-On
- Agents are activated only when their phase begins
- Agents complete their tasks and go dormant
- Multiple agents can run in parallel if no dependencies

### 3. Continuous Learning
- Each agent documents lessons learned in Issue comments
- Rules are updated via PRs when patterns emerge
- Failed approaches are documented to prevent repetition

## 🔄 Agent Lifecycle

```
DORMANT → ACTIVATED → IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW → COMPLETE → DORMANT
```

### State Transitions

1. **DORMANT → ACTIVATED**
   - Trigger: Phase begins OR dependency completed
   - Action: Move issue to "Ready" column

2. **ACTIVATED → IN_PROGRESS**
   - Trigger: Agent starts work
   - Action: Move issue to "In Progress", create branch

3. **IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW**
   - Trigger: PR created
   - Action: Move issue to "Review" column

4. **REVIEW → COMPLETE**
   - Trigger: PR merged, CI green
   - Action: Move issue to "Done", close issue

---

## ✅ Agent Work Rules

### Before Starting Work
1. Check issue is in "Ready" column
2. Check all blocking issues are closed
3. Self-assign or get assigned
4. Move issue to "In Progress"
5. Create branch: `agent/<name>/<issue>-<desc>`

### During Work
1. Update issue with progress comments (daily minimum)
2. Check off completed subtasks in issue body
3. Run `act` before each push
4. Keep commits small and focused
5. Document blockers immediately

### Completing Work
1. Ensure all acceptance criteria met
2. Create PR with issue link
3. Move issue to "Review"
4. Address review feedback promptly
5. After merge, verify issue auto-closes

### If Blocked
1. Move issue to "Blocked" column
2. Comment with blocker details
3. Tag blocking issue/person
4. Switch to another ready task if possible

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns (Don't Do These)

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do Instead |
|----------|---------------|
| Work without issue | Create issue first |
| Push without CI | Run `act` locally |
| Skip issue updates | Comment daily progress |
| Ignore blockers | Document and escalate |
| Large PRs (>500 lines) | Split into smaller PRs |
| Direct push to main | Always use PR |
| Hardcode secrets | Use environment/secrets |
| Skip tests | Add tests for new code |

---

## 📞 Communication Channels

| Purpose | Channel |
|---------|---------|
| Task discussion | Issue comments |
| Code discussion | PR comments |
| Architecture decisions | ADR in `docs/adr/` |
| Questions | GitHub Discussions |
| Urgent issues | Tag maintainer in issue |
| Rule changes | PR to this file |

---

## 🏆 Definition of Done

An agent task is DONE when:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria checked
- [ ] Tests pass (`flutter test`)
- [ ] Linting clean (`flutter analyze`)
- [ ] Local CI passes (`act`)
- [ ] PR approved and merged
- [ ] Issue closed
- [ ] No regressions in related features
